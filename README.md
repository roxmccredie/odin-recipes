Building a basic recipe website

This website will consist of:

    * HTML code:
        * main index page with
            * headers
            * paragraphs
            * lists
            * links
            * images

Once completed, this website will demonstrate the skills I have learned. How to create 
an html index page, how to properly use elements, creating headers vs paragraphs, ordered lists 
vs unordered lists, and how to add links to content directing the user to a new page via an 
absolute or relative link.
